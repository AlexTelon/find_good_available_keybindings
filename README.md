The idea is to find keyboard combinations that are unusual in english.

My goal is to then narrow down which one on the home row are least likely so that I can assign keyboard shortcuts on my custom ergodox layout based on this.

If I hold down:

    F or J -> Ctrl
    D or K -> Alt
    S or L -> Shift

While if I just tap the key the normal letter appears.

And while I do have the timing down mostly I want to avoid having keyboard combinations (where I can) that could happen while typing english if I accidentally hold down a key on the home row too long

Example:

The word "fly" could be interpreted as 
`Ctrl - l, f` if i hold down f for too long. Again, almost never an issue. But it would be good to find the safest combinations! :)
